# ReFi Intro

Our environment provides many benefits to humans (such as clean air, water, and productive soil), these are called Ecosystem Services. The quantity of natural assets which provide these ecosystem services (such as geology, soil, air, water, and biomass) are referred to as Natural Capital. By putting a numeric value on ecosystem services and natural capital, market-based pricing and coordination mechanisms can be used to determine the monetary value of them. Regenerative Finance (ReFi) is the process of using various forms of capital to drive systematic, sustainable, and positive change for all stakeholders. It leverages natural capital currencies and other tokenized assets for the preservation of life and ecological health. Internalizing the externalities and realizing the true value of these assets can allow us to preserve and regenerate the biosphere. Allowing us to escape a system of exploitation leading towards scarcity, and instead creating new systems that function in regeneration leading towards abundance. The most commonly known ReFi token used currently, is carbon credits.
