# Domain Experts

For each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system. As these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury.

Moonjelly&#x20;

A decentralized ocean conservation organization that has world class scientists and data intelligence personnel, specializing in the ocean, throughout the organization. Linwood Pendleton Ph.d. is an example of such a scientist. Has experts in the field of ocean monitoring and verification.

Endangered Species Foundation&#x20;

Endangered species are especially fragile and need extreme support as quick as possible in order to maintain and increase their population before they go extinct. This organization is reevaluating the biodiversity that these species represent by creating web3 assets (NFTs, tokens). This organization brings specialized knowledge into this area and is working on the ground to ensure that the endangered species are being protected, along with collecting data about the regenerative actions being done around these species.&#x20;

Open Forest Protocol&#x20;

This organization brings specialized knowledge sets for reforestation and afforestation projects throughout the world.&#x20;

Regen&#x20;

Regen aligns economics with ecology to drive regenerative land management. Regen has a specialization currently in regenerative agricultural techniques.&#x20;

BasinDAO&#x20;

This organization comes in with real property values and the legal implications behind acquiring rights to properties. Currently specializing in the analysis of watershed (or Basin) level regeneration.&#x20;

Kolektivo&#x20;

Curacao has been benefiting from the efforts of this organization for the last couple of years. From this the organization gained substantial expertise in working with local communities and creating local economic systems.&#x20;

Avano&#x20;

Avano is creating a NFT layer for supporting regenerative actions. Avano has specialized in utilizing the InVEST toolset from the Natural Capital project for analyzing regenerative actions and the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by them.
