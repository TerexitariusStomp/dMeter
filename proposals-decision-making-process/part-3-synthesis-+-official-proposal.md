# Part 3 - Synthesis + Official Proposal

You may now set status to Ready To Vote, add final revisions, and prepare to submit for official vote

The core team can then provide further feedback. If the proposer feels like they have the necessary buy in for the proposal to pass a 2/3 majority of core stewards (currently at least 4 out of the 6), they can post the proposal on Snapshot for an official vote. They can set a voting deadline defaulting to 7 days using Snapshot to incentivize quick participation on the proposal. If there's not enough by-in on the proposal, the voting deadline may be extended to accommodate for it.

Once proposal has been submitted to Snapshot, change status to In Voting, and make sure to share the snapshot link with dMeter members, as well as add the link to the table below.
