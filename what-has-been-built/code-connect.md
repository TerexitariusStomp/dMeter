# Code Connect

How can you fairly reward each member based on their contribution? The contributors know best, so let's find a way to reward their efforts. Using a combination of the MTE application, Safe and Safe Module, Snapshot, Push and Github a mechanism whereby contributors vote on how valuable each contributors contribution was and are able to claim funds accordingly is created. This is able to now incentivize open source coders and methodology creators, such as those from InVest network of Stanford, to become stakeholders of projects.&#x20;
