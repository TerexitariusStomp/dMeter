# Working Circles

_Circles are the organizing fabric of how dMeter gets work done. Inspired_

_by the_ [_Sociocracy_ ](https://sociocracyforall.org/)_model, circles collaborate in a horizontal way to reach_

_our shared goals._

**Current Working Circles**

Are best represented in our Discord

Engineering - Engineer the Product - Design the data collection design and analysis implementation process.



Demand Sensing - Understand the User - Analyze the potential markets for our data and engage the relevant customers to identify customer needs and opportunities to add value. Will work with data collection and analysis to define requirements for data to acquire that covers all potential market use scenarios



Gov Ops- Steward the dMeter System - develop dMeterâ€™s internal structure and external appearance. Define the governance structure and roles that are necessary to facilitate the work of the other groups.
